# Connected Care

An app to help residents' families connect to care facilities.

This app can also be used for daycares.  It allows family members to check in without the distractions that go along with social media.

Here is the [link](https://connected-care.onrender.com) to this project deployed on Render.  
Note: It is not working right now, but it was previously.

It has 3 Models in use:
- Client
- User
- Message

Message is not fully operational, I have tried to solve it,
but made the mistake of leaving work until too late.  In the future, I will 
start projects earlier so that I can ask questions if I run into problems before classes end.
